  After graduating with a degree in{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">Computer Engineering</span>, I decided to pursue my
  passion for software development. I gained experience through internships and{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">frontend development</span> projects. My core stack
  is{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">
    React, Next.js, and TypeScript
  </span>
  . I am also proficient in{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">Python and C++</span>. I am always looking to
  learn new technologies. I am presently working as a{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">Coding and Robotics Instructor at STEMINAI</span> while
  seeking new opportunities as a software developer.
</p>

<p>
  <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy teaching and sharing
  knowledge, exploring new technologies, and working on{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">hardware-software projects</span>. I also enjoy{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span> beyond tech. Recently,
  Iâ€™ve been diving into{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">Robotics</span> while
  continuing to grow my engineering and programming skills.
